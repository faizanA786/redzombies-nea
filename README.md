# Red Zombies
I developed a 2D top-down shooter game as part of my A-level Computer Science coursework, inspired by the round-based zombies mode in Call of Duty. Built using Unity (2020) and C#, the game features stripped-down graphics and core mechanics such as differing weapons, wave progression, and resource management

## Features
### Wave difficulty system
As you progress through each wave, the games difficulty will adapt, increasing more enemies spawn, speed and attack all while making things cost more like repleneshing ammo.
### Weapons
Access to various weapons like a pistol, assault rifle, shotgun and a rocket launcher
### Traps
Buy slow traps that slow enemies down or damage traps that repeatedly damage enemies over time
### Obstacles
Buy to open up space for the map to have more moving ground for a greater chance of survival
### Enemies
From three different enemies, the standard zombie, the smaller, weaker yet more faster zombie and a rare zombie that explodes on impact, taking out everything near it.
